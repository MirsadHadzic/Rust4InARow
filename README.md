# Quick Overview

In this project, we created the logic of a Connect 4 game, and were able to display it in ASCII form for the user to play in the terminal.
We wrote this software as a way of learning the language Rust.

# Environment

For this project, we needed to install VS Code, Rust, the Rust extension in Visual Studio Code, and create a rust project through the command prompt.

For this project, I didn't need to import lots of libraries. The only library I needed was std. This allowed for me to use std::io:stdin() for getting input from the user, and std::process::exit() to kill the program when necessary.
